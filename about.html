      <p>Floodline was founded with a simple belief: startups deserve access to experienced technology leadership without the overhead of full-time hires.</p>
      <p>We partner with founders at critical moments—when you're making foundational technology decisions, scaling your team, or navigating complex technical challenges. Our hands-on approach means we're not just advisors; we're collaborators who understand the urgency and constraints of early-stage companies.</p>
      <p>Based on the Canadian prairies, we bring a grounded, no-nonsense approach to technology consulting. We focus on what matters and skip the rest.</p>
