        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>At Floodline, we've split discovery into its own phase to ensure a thorough understanding of your project needs.</p>
        <p>With many software vendors, the project discovery process tied to a large project commitment. We understand that within a startup, those types of commitments can be challenging. By offering Discovery as a standalone service, we allow you to explore your ideas without the pressure of a full project commitment, leaving you with an actionable <b>Solution Plan</b> to inform your scope and decisions moving into development.</p>
        <p>Whether you build with Floodline or take the plan elsewhere, Discovery gives you the clarity to move forward with confidence.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clear <b>Solution Plan</b> outlining what to build and why</li>
          <li>A refined, MVP-ready scope with prioritized features</li>
          <li>A realistic timeline and cost estimate you can plan around</li>
        </ul>
